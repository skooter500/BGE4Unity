The goal of this assignment is to recreate a classic space battle using the game AI techniques you are learning on the course. Your assignment should tell a story and as much as possible, the behaviours of the ships should be programmed rather than using any built in stuff in Unity. If you dont like sci-fi, then a nature simulation is also cool. Try and avoid Star Wars because itâ€™s been done to death, but if you really want to do Star Wars, you can. I suggest you pick classic sci-fi such as any of the following:

- 2001 A Space Odyssey
- Buck Rogers in the 25th Centuary
- Space 1999
- UFO
- Battle of the Planets
- Star Trek
- Darkstar
- The Last Starfighter
- Battlestar Galactica

Use any game engine you like (including any game engine you might be ), but most people use Unity3D

## Interm assignment
This is due on 17 February 2015 and worth 10% (not graded). You must submit:

- Git repo link to...
- A project where you have all your assets imported (models etc)
- A scene with some space ships
- One of your ships should implement a path following behaviour
- A storyboard for the story in your assignment laying out the different scenes, cameras and behaviours.

The main assignment is due *14 April 2015*

Rubric
======


| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Your assignment runs entirely autonomously. You have developed new steering behaviours to achieve the ship AI. You have used several FSMs or behaviour trees or introduced some AI techniques that we did not cover on the course. The behaviours you implemented are complex. Lots of code and maths. You have created new classes to abstract the complexity of your assignment. Alternatively, you used your own custom engine to do the assignment. Scene switching is seemless and natural and your assignment looks like a short movie. It has a story. Your models are appropriate. There are lots of scenes with different camera behaviours. Attention to detail.|
| 2.1 | Your assignment is entirely autonomous. You have used the full range of appropriate behaviours from the ones we did on the course. Maybe some of the behaviours are not 100% natural looking and might benefit from further tweeking. Some of your behaviours are timed or triggered rather that being entirely reactive. There are no new behaviours, or if you implemented new behaviours, they are relatively straightforward. Not so complex. Your assignment has a story, but maybe there are some bits where not much is happening. Cameras are mostly static. Most of the models look ok, but maybe there are one or two that are dont entirely fit or that you had issues with. |
| 2.2 | The assignment is not entirely autonomous. Some of the bits need to be manualy stitched together. You have used a few behaviours such as path following and maybe offset pursuit. There are max 4 short "scenes" or segments. 100% code and behaviours we covered in class. |
| Pass | Pretty much just one scene with some path following ships|
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. No code changes to the supplied code. |
